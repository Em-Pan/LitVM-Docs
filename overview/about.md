# About

## What is LitVM?

LitVM (Litecoin Virtual Machine) is Litecoin's first trustless EVM rollup, designed to unlock the full spectrum of Web3 functionality for the Litecoin community. Endorsed by the Litecoin Foundation, LitVM transforms Litecoin from a payment-focused network into a fully programmable Web3 ecosystem.

Built using Arbitrum Nitro and powered by BitcoinOS technology, LitVM delivers a decentralized, EVM-compatible smart contract layer on Litecoin—enabling Web3 functionality such as DeFi, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, yield opportunities, and AI-driven applications while inheriting Litecoin's battle-tested proof-of-work security.

## Sound Money Web3

LitVM follows the mantra of "Sound Money Web3"—bringing the principles of sound money (scarcity, security, and decentralization) to programmable blockchain applications. By bridging trustless native Litecoin and Litecoin-native assets via BitcoinOS's ZK technology, LitVM empowers these decentralized assets with lightning-fast EVM smart contract capabilities.

## Our Mission

LitVM is built around five core objectives:

* Create more demand for LTC — Drive adoption and utility for Litecoin as a base layer asset
* Unlock Sound Money Web3 — Solve the trustless sound money issue in Web3 for retail, funds, institutions, treasuries and governments
* Foster a utility-driven and cross-chain future for Litecoin users — Connect Litecoin to the broader Web3 ecosystem
* Enable yield-generation opportunities for LTC holders — Provide sustainable earning mechanisms for the Litecoin community
* Create a vibrant Litecoin-powered ecosystem — Primary focus on yield, RWAs, and AI applications

## Who is LitVM For?

### For Litecoin Holders

* Access yield opportunities without giving up custody of your LTC
* Participate in DeFi protocols using trustlessly bridged Litecoin
* Engage with Litecoin-native assets (LTC, Ordinals, Runes, LTC-20s, Charms) in a programmable environment

### For Developers

* Deploy EVM-compatible smart contracts using familiar tools (Solidity, Hardhat etc.)
* Unlock a large and active target market of Litecoin holders
* Build on Litecoin's 14+ years of proof-of-work security
* Leverage ZK technology for scalable, low-cost applications

### For Enterprises

* Tokenize real-world assets with L1-secured infrastructure
* Access institutional-grade yield strategies
* Build compliant, scalable blockchain solutions

## The Litecoin Advantage

Litecoin has been at the forefront of blockchain innovation for over a decade:

* 360+ million lifetime transactions processed
* 2.5-minute block times (4x faster than Bitcoin)
* Scrypt-based consensus for broad, decentralized mining
* First to implement SegWit, Lightning Network, and MimbleWimble (MWEB)
* 14+ years of uninterrupted operation and security

LitVM builds on this foundation, bringing smart contract capabilities to one of the most trusted and widely-used blockchain networks in the world.

## Endorsements

"This is an important step in the maturation of the Litecoin ecosystem. Since creating Litecoin in 2011, Litecoin's development and awareness has remained focused on security, reliability, and accessibility for everyday transactions. LitVM extends these values into the programmable blockchain era. We’re excited to see the potential wave of innovation this will hopefully catalyze across our ecosystem."

— Charlie Lee, Creator of Litecoin & Director of the Litecoin Foundation

"The Litecoin community has been ready for this type of thing to come along for a long time. Everything about LitVM resonates with me, as a person who loves utility. I’ve been a strong advocate of having smart contracts on Litecoin. To take all of the things you can do on a VM and to have that on Litecoin, and to be the first, I think that’s going to be very special."

— David Schwartz, Director of Partnerships at the Litecoin Foundation
