# $LITVM & $zkLTC

LitVM operates with a dual-token model designed to align incentives across the ecosystem while maintaining the principles of sound money. Each token serves a distinct purpose in powering the network.

## zkLTC — The Gas Token

### What is zkLTC?

**zkLTC** is a fully-collateralized representation of Litecoin (LTC) on LitVM. It serves as the **native gas token** for all transactions on the network and the primary base asset for DeFi protocols.

### How zkLTC Works

### Key Properties

| **Property**    | **Description**                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1:1 Backing** | Every zkLTC is backed by LTC locked on Litecoin mainchain |
| **Trustless**   | Bridging uses ZK proofs—no custodians or multisig         |
| **Gas Token**   | Used to pay transaction fees on LitVM                     |
| **Base Asset**  | Primary liquidity pair for DeFi protocols                 |
| **Redeemable**  | Can always be bridged back to native LTC                  |

### zkLTC Use Cases

* **Transaction Fees**: Pay gas for smart contract interactions
* **DeFi Collateral**: Use as collateral in lending protocols
* **Trading Pairs**: Base pair for DEX liquidity pools
* **Yield Strategies**: Earn rewards by engaging in yield markets
* **Cross-Chain Transfers**: Move value across connected chains

### Why zkLTC Instead of Wrapped LTC?

Traditional wrapped tokens rely on centralized custodians or multisig schemes. zkLTC is fundamentally different:

| **Aspect**            | **Wrapped LTC (Traditional)** | **zkLTC (BitcoinOS)**   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Custody**           | Third-party custodian         | Non-custodial           |
| **Trust**             | Trust the custodian           | Trust math (ZK proofs)  |
| **Verification**      | Off-chain attestation         | On-chain proof          |
| **Counterparty Risk** | High                          | Minimal                 |
| **Redemption**        | Depends on custodian          | Guaranteed via protocol |

## $LITVM — The Governance & Utility Token

### What is $LITVM?

**$LITVM** is the native governance and utility token of the LitVM ecosystem. It coordinates activity between the economic, governance, and strategic layers of the network, making them function as a cohesive unit.

### Token Utility

#### Governance

$LITVM powers the **Litecoin DAO**, giving token holders rights to:

* Vote on protocol parameters and upgrades
* Propose and approve ecosystem grants
* Participate in strategic funding decisions
* Shape the future direction of LitVM

**Governance Incentives:** Active participants who vote, propose, and engage in community dialogue are eligible for rewards, encouraging ongoing engagement.

#### Revenue Sharing

LitVM is one of the few Layer-2 platforms explicitly designed to share protocol revenue with its community:

**Sequencer Fee Distribution**

* Sequencers order and batch transactions on LitVM
* A percentage of sequencer fees flows to $LITVM holders and/or stakers
* Unlike chains where fees go entirely to operators, LitVM distributes value back

This model transforms core infrastructure usage into tangible, recurring revenue that flows directly to community members. It's a model that aligns protocol growth with stakeholder benefit, extending $LITVM beyond an ordinary governance token into a claim on the economic activity of its network.

#### Ecosystem Access

* Priority access to new protocol launches
* Participation in Litecoin DAO initiatives
* Eligibility for ecosystem incentive programs

### Tokenomics

LitVM's tokenomics prioritize the community over insiders:

**51% Community Allocation** — Over half of all tokens are reserved for the community, prioritizing current Litecoin holders and welcoming new ecosystem participants.

### Revenue Model

LitVM's revenue model creates sustainable value through protocol fees:

Rather than relying on inflationary rewards or inorganic social hype, LitVM transforms core infrastructure usage into tangible, recurring revenue that flows directly to community members.

### Institutional Yield Infrastructure

LitVM is bringing yield infrastructure designed for institutional capital:

* **DNA Fund Strategy Vaults**: Actively managed products for high-net-worth individuals and funds (in addition to retail users)
* **Management & Performance Fees**: Portion redirected to $LITVM holders and/or stakers
* **Retail Access**: Institutional strategies available to everyday users

## Why Two Tokens?

The dual-token model serves distinct purposes:

| **Aspect**           | **zkLTC**                      | **$LITVM**             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Primary Function** | Gas & Base Asset               | Governance & Utility   |
| **Backing**          | 1:1 with LTC                   | Protocol value         |
| **Supply**           | Elastic (based on bridged LTC) | Fixed                  |
| **Use Case**         | Transactions & DeFi            | Voting & Revenue       |
| **Economic Role**    | Sound money base layer         | Ecosystem coordination |

### Benefits of Separation

* **Sound Money Preservation**: Gas fees paid in LTC-backed asset maintains Litecoin's monetary properties
* **Clear Incentives**: Governance token aligns long-term stakeholders
* **Sustainable Economics**: Revenue sharing creates value beyond speculation
* **Flexible Tokenomics**: Each token can be optimized for its specific role
